3. Move guest details to `guests.ts`: Guest interface, type Skier, SpaEnthusiast, Foodie, ThrillSeeker, GuestWithActivity
4. Move activity details to `activities.ts`, Activity interface, `skiLesson`, `cookingClass`, and `massage`.
5. Export necessary types from `guests.ts`.
6. Import necessary types in `activities.ts`.
