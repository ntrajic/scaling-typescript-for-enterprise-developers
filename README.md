Looking to elevate your coding skills from simple type annotations to sophisticated data modeling and API integration? Join instructor Eve Porcello to boost your understanding of TypeScript's core principles, such as classes and interfaces as well as complex concepts like generics and utility types. Learn to construct robust and type-safe applications by managing code structure through namespaces, modules, and data models. Gain practical experience with hands-on coding capstone projects that simulate real-world programming challenges. Learn how to write cleaner, more efficient code as well as how to debug, test, and automate projects using tools like Vitest and VS Code. Whether you're a developer looking to transition to TypeScript, enhance your existing skills, or a student eager to explore typed JavaScript, this course offers valuable insights and skills that can help you become a proficient TypeScript developer.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

# conditional statement in type script, a type guard example

        One way to use a type guard in a class is a conditional statement. Type guards are commonly implemented using conditional statements (such as if statements) to check the type or properties of a variable at runtime, allowing TypeScript to narrow the type within that block. For example, you might define a class method that acts as a user-defined type guard and use it inside an if statement to refine the type of this or another object.

        Hereâ€™s a simple example of using a type guard in a class with a conditional statement in TypeScript:

        typescript
        class Animal {
        name: string;
        constructor(name: string) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        }

        class Dog extends Animal {
        bark() {
            console.log("Woof!");
        }
        }

        class Cat extends Animal {
        meow() {
            console.log("Meow!");
        }
        }

        // Type guard function  <<<<<<<<<
        function isDog(animal: Animal): animal is Dog {
        return animal instanceof Dog;
        }

        // Usage in a method with a conditional statement
        function makeSound(animal: Animal) {
        if (isDog(animal)) { // <-- type guard used in a conditional statement
            animal.bark();     // TypeScript knows animal is a Dog here
        } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
            animal.meow();
        }
        }

        const dog = new Dog("Rex");
        const cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

        makeSound(dog); // Output: Woof!
        makeSound(cat); // Output: Meow!

        Explanation:

        The isDog function is a type guard that checks if an Animal is actually a Dog.
        In the makeSound function, a conditional statement (if (isDog(animal))) is used to narrow the type.
        Inside the if block, TypeScript knows animal is a Dog, so you can safely call bark().
        This is a classic way to use a type guard with a conditional statement in a class-based TypeScript program.
